wget found on GTFO bins if it has sudo privilges it can leed to privilge escalation by an attacker after gaining initial access... The attacker sends the /etc/sudoers file to a listening netcat instance on his machine then makes the needed changes for the use with wget-sudo privilge to become root and then uses wget again to get the edited file from the attacker machine and puts the file in the /etc directory thus replacing the original /sudoers file
